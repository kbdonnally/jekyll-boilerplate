# Jekyll Boilerplate 

## What I want set up:

1. Config
2. Gulp
3. .gitignore
4. Crucial SVGs
5. html-to-css.py
6. Collections directory
7. Dictionary of useful commands
8. Flexible navigation JS
9. The "page" layout from `patterns`
10. Travis, if can get to work...
11. Annotated directory structure
12. Basic custom theme
13. Docs

## Handling out of order:

### #10: Travis CI

- As usual, I have found this mystifying, which means I should probably suck it up and learn Ruby, but alas

- Anyway, Jekyll has some [excellent documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/travis-ci/) on how to set up this magic, so return to it when you have more things that this will actually be, like, useful for.

*Marking for later review.*

### #3: `.gitignore`

- Handled! Compatible with any site like your patterns repo or the SLab site.

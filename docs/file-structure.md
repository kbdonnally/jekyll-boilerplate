# File Structure

`.github/`

- **Name:** generated by GitHub
- **Contains:** info that GitHub uses to make Issues and Pull Requests easier to write, and more standard to read.
- These used to just go under `docs/` with everything else, but GitHub recently (as of July 2018) introduced a feature that custom-builds multiple types of issue templates.
	- This is really helpful, because people want changes to the site for all sorts of reasons: to fix a bug, to request a theoretical feature, to ask for help on something really broad...
	- It means that issue templates were pretty bloated to cover all the possible ground someone might need to write, which in turn means that people (read: perhaps... a few SLabbers... or all of us...) would delete the whole template and just write down the stuff we had time to.
	- That resulted in way *less* organized issues, which defeats the purpose!
- Anyway, since there are now a fair number of files defining "meta"-documentation (docs on how to participate in the code), I figured that made more sense to live in the `.github/` folder, which is where GitHub puts these things by default.
	- That way, this folder is just full of stuff that's meant for humans to actually read. :)

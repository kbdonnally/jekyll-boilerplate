# Gulp Workflow

- Link to the docs I made on the SLab site for more details, but wanted to cover some stuff about initial setup.

## Prerequisites

- See Gulp docs on SLab site re. Node.js & npm

- Will need to have a `package.json` file, where all of your info on JS libraries lives. The [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) on this process is very good.

## Installation & Writing Gulpfile

- Again, mostly covered in SLab docs
